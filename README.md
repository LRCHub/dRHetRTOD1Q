```lrc
[00:45.39] When I look back upon my life
[00:48.78] It's always with a sense of shame
[00:52.97] I've always been the one to blame
[01:09.47] 
[00:58.95] For everything I long to do
[01:05.70] No matter where or when or who
[01:09.74] Has one thing in common, too
[01:14.04] It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
[01:31.04] 
[01:18.06] It's a sin
[01:23.06] 
[01:25.89] Everything I've ever done
[01:27.58] Everything I'll ever do
[01:29.20] Every place I've ever been
[01:31.09] Everywhere I'm going to
[01:34.26] It's a sin
[01:39.26] 
[01:36.54] At school they taught me how to be
[01:39.29] So pure in thought and word and deed
[01:43.49] They didn't quite succeed
[01:47.73] Oh no
[01:50.90] For everything I long to do
[01:54.56] No matter where or when or who
[01:58.29] Has one thing in common, too
[02:02.67] It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
[02:19.67] 
[02:06.49] It's a sin
[02:11.49] 
[02:15.24] Everything I've ever done
[02:16.20] Everything I'll ever do
[02:18.01] Every place I've ever been
[02:19.99] Everywhere I'm going to
[02:23.31] It's a sin
[02:28.31] 
[02:25.42] Father forgive me, I tried not to do it
[02:32.20] Turned over a new leaf, then tore right through it
[02:39.23] Whatever you taught me, I didn't believe it
[02:46.85] Father, you fought me, 'cause I didn't care
[02:52.80] And I still not understand
[03:05.80] 
[02:59.42] So I look back upon my life
[03:03.02] Forever with a sense of shame
[03:06.95] I've always been the one to blame
[03:23.45] 
[03:15.22] For everything I long to do
[03:19.46] No matter where or when or who
[03:23.50] Has one thing in common, too
[03:27.59] It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
[03:44.59] 
[03:32.95] It's a sin
[03:37.95] 
[03:39.28] Everything I've ever done
[03:41.09] Everything I'll ever do
[03:43.45] Every place I've ever been
[03:44.94] Everywhere I'm going to - it's a sin
[04:20.04] It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
[04:26.44] It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
