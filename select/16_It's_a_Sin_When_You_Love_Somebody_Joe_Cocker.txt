Now the Lord will forgive you if you're cheatin'
And the Lord will forgive you if you're lyin'
Yes, he'll forgive and help you to live
But he sure frowns down
Soundly on the likes of you and I, babe

'Cause it's be a sin when you love somebody
Damned if you do, twice damned if you don't
It's a sin when you love somebody
As much as I'm lovin' you

Now the Lord has been known for his kindness
Always willin' to set poor sinners free
He'll forgive and help you to love
But I still don't see no angels shine down on you and me, baby

'Cause it's be a sin when you love somebody
Damned if you do, twice damned if you don't
It's a sin when you love somebody
Love you like I'm lovin' you
C'mon girls, tell it right 'ere

(It's a sin when you love somebody) Somebody as I'm lovin' you
(Damned if you don't, twice damned if you do)
(It's a sin when you love somebody)
As much as I'm lovin' you, I'm lovin' you,
What am I doin' now, I'm lovin' now, yeah (ooh)

(It's a sin when you love somebody)
(Damned if you don't, twice damned if you do)
(It's a sin when you love somebody)
As much as I'm lovin' you (ooh)
